### Hello!

I'm Ian, a full-stack software engineer with proficiency in Javascript and Typescript, Next.js, Express, React, MongoDB, SQL, and Git. I'm a curious individual who strives to dig deep to truly understand the way things work. I love learning and engaging in challenging projects. Avid cyclist 🚴‍♂️ and amateur machinist 👨‍🏭 in my free time.

Here's [an app](https://slice-henna.vercel.app/) that I've been working on recently 🍜
