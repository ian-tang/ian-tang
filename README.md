### Hello!

I'm Ian, a full-stack software engineer with proficiency in Javascript and Typescript, Next.js, Express, React, MongoDB, SQL, and Git. I'm a curious individual who strives to dig deep to truly understand the way things work. I love learning and engaging in challenging projects. Avid cyclist 🚴‍♂️ and amateur machinist 👨‍🏭 in my free time.

Here's [an app](https://github.com/MagReda16/slice) that I've been working on recently, and you can try it out [here](https://slice-henna.vercel.app/) 🍜

You can reach me at [ian.tang@protonmail.com](ian.tang@protonmail.com) or through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/itang/).
